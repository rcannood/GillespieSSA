Title: Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA)
Version: 0.6.1
Description: Provides a simple to use, intuitive, and
  extensible interface to several stochastic simulation
  algorithms for generating simulated trajectories of finite
  population continuous-time model. Currently it implements
  Gillespie's exact stochastic simulation algorithm (Direct
  method) and several approximate methods (Explicit tau-leap,
  Binomial tau-leap, and Optimized tau-leap). The package also
  contains a library of template models that can be run as demo
  models and can easily be customized and extended. Currently the
  following models are included, 'Decaying-Dimerization' reaction
  set, linear chain system, logistic growth model, 'Lotka'
  predator-prey model, Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model,
  'Kermack-McKendrick' SIR model, and a 'metapopulation' SIRS model.
