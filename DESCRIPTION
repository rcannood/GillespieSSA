Description: GillespieSSA provides a simple to use, intuitive, and
        extensible interface to several stochastic simulation
        algorithms for generating simulated trajectories of finite
        population continuous-time model. Currently it implements
        Gillespie's exact stochastic simulation algorithm (Direct
        method) and several approximate methods (Explicit tau-leap,
        Binomial tau-leap, and Optimized tau-leap). The package also
        contains a library of template models that can be run as demo
        models and can easily be customized and extended. Currently the
        following models are included, decaying-dimerization reaction
        set, linear chain system, logistic growth model, Lotka
        predator-prey model, Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model,
        Kermack-McKendrick SIR model, and a metapopulation SIRS model.
